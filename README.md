# bibi

bibi is a benchtop buddy that can cruise around your desk and wipe it down for you. bibi will be able to do a bunch of cleaning tasks like wiping, vacuuming, or spraying; weâ€™re making those features modular so you can swap them out depending on what you need.  

bibi will also use sensors for obstacle detection and edge avoidance. with a little face on a display so it can show system feedback and have some personality while it works.  

love u bb <3
