# bibi

bibi is a benchtop buddy that can cruise around your desk. it has two modules that you can interchange, allowing bibi to either wipe down or vacuum your desk!

bibi will also use sensors for obstacle detection and edge avoidance, with a little face on a display so it can show system feedback and have some personality while it works.  

love u bb <3
